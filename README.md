# Lania

The role of Lania is to create an image gate between guilds.<br/>
Once a gate is open in a channel, you can send an image and see the reactions people add to it.<br/>
If you receive an image, you can also add reactions to it, people who send it will then see them.<br/><br/>

If you open the gate in a SFW channel you must send only SFW content (that mean no picture containing nudity, violence, or simply no picture against Discord ToS).<br/>
The only type of NSFW content allowed in NSFW channels is nudity (as long as it follow Discord ToS)<br/>
Any attempt to bypass our filter will result in a permanent ban.<br/>
Please make not that SFW channels can send images to both NSFW and SFW channels but NSFW channels can only send images to others NSFW channels.<br/>
