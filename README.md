# Lania

The role of Lania is to create an image gate between guilds.<br/>
Once a gate is open in a channel, you can send an image and see the reactions people add to it.<br/>
If you receive an image, you can also add reactions to it, people who send it will then see them.<br/><br/>

You must only send safe for work pictures (that mean no picture containing nudity, violence, or simply no picture against Discord ToS).<br/>
Any attempt to bypass our filter will result in a permanent ban.<br/>
